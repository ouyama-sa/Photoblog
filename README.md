# Photoblog

Photoblog is a minimalist and responsive website inspired by Fotolog, focusing on showcasing images in a gallery format. The project employs semantic HTML tags and modern CSS techniques for a clean and visually appealing design.

## Semantic HTML Tags

- `<header>`: Represents the header of the page, containing the site navigation and search form.
- `<nav>`: Defines the navigation section with a logo and a list of menu items.
- `<form>`: Encloses the search form for users to search for pictures and collections.
- `<main>`: Represents the main content of the page, including the gallery.
- `<section>`: Divides the content into different sections, such as the gallery section.
- `<figure>`: Represents a figure or image within the gallery.
- `<figcaption>`: Provides a caption or details about each image within the gallery.
- `<footer>`: Contains the footer of the page with copyright information.

## CSS Techniques

### Variables

- `:root`: Defines CSS custom properties (variables) for colors, font sizes, and other values used throughout the styles.
- Custom properties, such as `--color-base-white`, `--color-base-gray-100`, etc.: Used for consistent color theming.

### Grid Layout

- `display: grid;`: Utilized to create a grid layout for the main content, allowing for a responsive design.
- `grid-template-rows`, `grid-template-columns`: Specifies the layout structure of rows and columns in the grid.

### Transitions and Animations

- `transition`: Applied to create smooth transitions on hover effects for images in the gallery.
- `@keyframes`: Defined animations for elements, such as the appearance of gallery items and header/footer movement.

### Responsive Design

- Media queries: Not explicitly included in the provided code, but the use of relative units and responsive layout practices contributes to a responsive design.
